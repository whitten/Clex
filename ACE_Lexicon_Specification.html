<h1>ACE 6.7 Lexicon Specification</h1>


<h2>General notes</h2>

<p>This document describes the lexicon format for ACE 6.7.</p>

<p>Lexicons can be used in two ways. They can be used as a <em>Clex</em> ("common lexicon" or "compiled
lexicon") which is compiled into the APE executable. Alternatively, they can be used as a <em>Ulex</em>
("user lexicon" or "uncompiled lexicon") that is loaded at run-time using the command line, the web
interface, the web service, or any other interface to the parser.</p>

<p>User lexicons <em>Ulex</em> can be used independently, or can complement <em>Clex</em> in 
which case entries of <em>Ulex</em> take precedence over those of <em>Clex</em>.</p>

<p>The ACE lexicon describes English adverbs, adjectives, nouns, verbs, and prepositions.
It does not describe function words like pronouns or quantifiers. There are 11 different word classes:
adverbs, intransitive adjectives, transitive adjectives, countable nouns, mass nouns, measurement nouns,
proper names, intransitive verbs, transitive verbs, ditransitive verbs, and prepositions.</p>

<p>The different forms of the words are represented by different Prolog facts. Each fact
minimally contains one entry that defines the word form which will appear in the ACE text, and
one entry that defines the symbol how it will appear in the logical representation. All entries
must be Prolog atoms. Furthermore, the entry for the word form (that will appear in the ACE text)
must contain nothing but lower and upper case letters (<code>a-z</code>,
<code>A-Z</code>), digits (<code>0-9</code>), hyphens (<code>-</code>), underscores (<code>_</code>),
dollar signs (<code>$</code>), and degree signs (<code>°</code>). The first character must not be
a digit or a hyphen. Blank spaces are not allowed. You should use hyphens in places where blank spaces
would be used in natural English. E.g. write 'credit-card' instead of 'credit card'.</p>

<p>Because the lexicon is written in Prolog, symbols special for Prolog
(e.g. apostrophe) must be escaped. Capitalized words (e.g. proper names)
must be in quotes, otherwise they would be considered variables by Prolog.</p>


<h2>Word classes</h2>

<h3>Adverbs</h3>

<p>Adverbs (e.g. "fast", "quickly", "intensively") are represented by
three different kinds of entries, defining the positive form, the comparative form, and the
superlative form respectively:</p>

<pre>
adv(PositiveForm, LogicalSymbol).
adv_comp(ComparativeForm, LogicalSymbol).
adv_sup(SuperlativeForm, LogicalSymbol).
</pre>

<p>For regular comparative and superlative forms (starting with "more" or
"most"), only the positive form needs to be defined. In order to use "more quickly", for example,
it is sufficient to define the positive form "quickly". Some concrete examples:</p>

<pre>
adv(fast, fast).
adv_comp(faster, fast).
adv_sup(fastest, fast).

adv(quickly, quickly).

adv(intensively, intensively).
</pre>

<p>It is recommended to use the positive form also as the logical symbol. Furthermore, it is recommended
to define a positive form for each comparative or superlative form.</p>


<h3>Intransitive adjectives</h3>

<p>Intransitive adjectives (e.g. "important", "large", "expensive") are represented by
three different kinds of entries, defining the positive form, the comparative form, and the
superlative form respectively:</p>

<pre>
adj_itr(PositiveForm, LogicalSymbol).
adj_itr_comp(ComparativeForm, LogicalSymbol).
adj_itr_sup(SuperlativeForm, LogicalSymbol).
</pre>

<p>Again, for regular comparative and superlative forms (starting with "more" or
"most"), only the positive form needs to be defined. Some concrete examples:</p>

<pre>
adj_itr(important, important).

adj_itr(large, large).
adj_itr_comp(larger, large).
adj_itr_sup(largest, large).

adj_itr(expensive, expensive).
</pre>

<p>It is recommended to use the positive form also as the logical symbol. Furthermore, it is recommended
to define a positive form for each comparative or superlative form.</p>


<h3>Transitive adjectives</h3>

<p>Transitive adjectives (e.g. "valid-for", "fond-of", "pessimistic-about") are represented by
three different kinds of entries, defining the positive form, the comparative form, and the
superlative form respectively:</p>

<pre>
adj_tr(PositiveForm, LogicalSymbol, Preposition).
adj_tr_comp(ComparativeForm, LogicalSymbol, Preposition).
adj_tr_sup(SuperlativeForm, LogicalSymbol, Preposition).
</pre>

<p>Transitive adjectives should consist of an adjective and a preposition that is hyphenated to the adjective.
Again, for regular comparative and superlative forms (starting with "more" or "most"), only the positive form needs to be defined.
<tt>Preposition</tt> is the preposition part of the word, e.g. "for" in the case of "valid-for", "of" in the case of "fond-of", and "about"
in the case of "pessimistic-about". It is only used for the comparative form in
sentences where the preposition can occur on its own, like in "Mary is more fond-of Bill than <strong>of</strong> John".
Some concrete examples:</p>

<pre>
adj_tr('valid-for', 'valid-for', for).

adj_tr('fond-of', 'fond-of', of).
adj_tr_comp('fonder-of', 'fond-of', of).
adj_tr_sup('fondest-of', 'fond-of', of).

adj_tr('pessimistic-about', 'pessimistic-about', about).
</pre>

<p>It is recommended to use the positive form also as the logical symbol. Furthermore, it is recommended
to define a positive form for each comparative or superlative form.</p>


<h3>Countable nouns</h3>

<p>Countable nouns (e.g. "woman", "credit-card", "month") are represented by
two different kinds of entries, defining the singular form and the plural form respectively:</p>

<pre>
noun_sg(SingularForm, LogicalSymbol, Gender).
noun_pl(PluralForm, LogicalSymbol, Gender).
</pre>

<p>Defining a countable noun "credit-card", for example, you can say "a credit-card",
"every credit-card", or "at most 5 credit-cards".
The plural form should usually be the singular form with an 's' at the end like
"credit-cards" or "months". Some concrete examples:</p>

<pre>
noun_sg(woman, woman, fem).
noun_pl(women, woman, fem).

noun_sg('credit-card', 'credit-card', neutr).
noun_pl('credit-cards', 'credit-card', neutr).

noun_sg(month, month, neutr).
noun_pl(months, month, neutr).
</pre>

<p><tt>Gender</tt> has to be one of {<tt>undef</tt>, <tt>neutr</tt>, <tt>human</tt>, <tt>masc</tt>, <tt>fem</tt>} and
specifies the linguistic gender of the noun. <tt>undef</tt> is the top category having two direct subcategories
<tt>neutr</tt> and <tt>human</tt> where <tt>human</tt> has again two subcategories <tt>masc</tt> and <tt>fem</tt>.
Depending on the gender, different forms of pronouns are supported. The table below shows the concrete pronouns.
Note that not only the pronouns listed for a particular gender but also all pronouns of all super- and subcategories
can be used.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>Gender</td>
<td>Anaphoric Pronouns</td>
<td>Possessive Pronouns</td>
<td>Relative Pronouns</td>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>undef</td>
<td>they, them, themselves</td>
<td>their, their own</td>
<td>that, whose</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>neutr</td>
<td>it, itself</td>
<td>its, its own</td>
<td>which</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>human</td>
<td>he/she, she/he, him/her, her/him, himself/herself, herself/himself</td>
<td>his/her, her/his, his/her own, her/his own</td>
<td>who</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>masc</td>
<td>he, him, himself</td>
<td>his, his own</td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>fem</td>
<td>she, her, herself</td>
<td>her, her own</td>
<td></td>
</tr>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>It is recommended to use the singular form also as the logical symbol. Furthermore, it is recommended
to define a singular form for each plural form, and vice versa.</p>


<h3>Mass nouns</h3>

<p>Countable nouns (e.g. "water", "fear", "money") are represented by only one kind of entry:</p>

<pre>
noun_mass(WordForm, LogicalSymbol, Gender).
</pre>

<p>Mass nouns have only one word form. Defining a mass noun "water",
for example, you can say "some water", "all water", or "5 kg of water".
The gender of mass nouns is defined in the same way as for countable nouns 
(see previous section). Some concrete examples:</p>

<pre>
noun_mass(water, water, neutr).

noun_mass(fear, fear, neutr).

noun_mass(money, money, neutr).
</pre>

<p>It is recommended to use the word form also as the logical symbol.</p>


<h3>Measurement nouns</h3>

<p>Measurement nouns (e.g. "kg", "m", "°C") are represented by only one kind of entry:</p>

<pre>
mn_sg(SingularForm, LogicalSymbol).
mn_pl(PluralForm, LogicalSymbol).
</pre>

<p>It is recommended to define measurement nouns in the form of measurement symbols (i.e. "m" instead of "meter").
In this case, the singular and plural forms should usually be the same. Some concrete examples:</p>

<pre>
mn_sg(kg, kg).
mn_pl(kg, kg).

mn_sg(m, m).
mn_pl(m, m).

mn_sg('°C', '°C').
mn_pl('°C', '°C').
</pre>

<p>It is recommended to use the singular form also as the logical symbol. Furthermore, it is recommended
to define a singular form for each plural form, and vice versa.</p>


<h3>Proper names</h3>

<p>Proper names come in two versions: one for those that require a preceeding definite article (e.g. "the Nile", "the United-Nations") and
one for those that stand by itself (e.g. "John", "Nokia"). Proper names can also be declared in both of those categories
(e.g. "(the) Mona-Lisa").</p>

<pre>
pn_sg(WordForm, LogicalSymbol, Gender).
pn_pl(WordForm, LogicalSymbol, Gender).
pndef_sg(WordForm, LogicalSymbol, Gender).
pndef_pl(WordForm, LogicalSymbol, Gender).
</pre>

<p><tt>Gender</tt> has the same meaning as for countable nouns. Some concrete examples:</p>

<pre>
pn_sg('John', 'John', masc).

pn_sg('Nokia', 'Nokia', neutr).

pndef_sg('Nile', 'Nile', neutr).

pndef_pl('United-Nations', 'United-Nations', neutr).

pn_sg('Mona-Lisa', 'Mona-Lisa', neutr).
pndef_sg('Mona-Lisa', 'Mona-Lisa', neutr).
</pre>

<p>It is not allowed to declare the same proper name as singular and plural at the same time.
It is recommended to use the word form also as the logical symbol.</p>


<h3>Intransitive verbs</h3>

<p>Intransitive verbs (e.g. "waits", "goes-away", "walks") are represented by
two different kinds of entries, defining the third singular form and the infinitive form respectively:</p>

<pre>
iv_finsg(ThirdSgForm, LogicalSymbol).
iv_infpl(InfForm, LogicalSymbol).
</pre>

<p>The infinitive form should usually be the singular form without the 's' at the end:
"wait", "walk". Phrasal particles should be hyphenated to the verb, e.g. "goes-away".
Some concrete examples:</p>

<pre>
iv_finsg(waits, wait).
iv_infpl(wait, wait).

iv_finsg('goes-away', 'go-away').
iv_infpl('go-away', 'go-away').

iv_finsg(walks, walk).
iv_infpl(walk, walk).
</pre>

<p>It is recommended to use the infinitive form also as the logical symbol. Furthermore, it is recommended
to define a third singular form for each infinitive form, and vice versa.</p>


<h3>Transitive verbs</h3>

<p>Transitive verbs (e.g. "knows", "likes", "relates-to") are represented by three different kinds of entries,
defining the third singular form, the infinitive form, and the past participle form respectively:</p>

<pre>
tv_finsg(ThirdSgForm, LogicalSymbol).
tv_infpl(InfForm, LogicalSymbol).
tv_pp(PastPartForm, LogicalSymbol).
</pre>

<p>Phrasal particles and direct prepositions should be hyphenated to the verb, e.g. "relates-to", "lives-in", and "comes-up-with".
The past participle is the form that is used for passive voice: "known", "liked", "seen". If it is not defined then
passive voice is not possible for the respective verb. Some concrete examples:</p>

<pre>
tv_finsg(knows, know).
tv_infpl(know, know).
tv_pp(known, know).

tv_finsg(likes, like).
tv_infpl(like, like).
tv_pp(liked, like).

tv_finsg('relates-to', 'relate-to').
tv_infpl('relate-to', 'relate-to').
tv_pp('related-to', 'relate-to').
</pre>

<p>It is recommended to use the infinitive form also as the logical symbol. It is also recommended
to define a third singular form for each infinitive form, and vice versa. Furthermore, it is recommended to
define third singular and infinitive forms for each past participle form.</p>


<h3>Ditransitive verbs</h3>

<p>Diransitive verbs (e.g. "shows", "forgives", "succeeds") are represented by three different kinds of entries,
defining the third singular form, the infinitive form, and the past participle form respectively:</p>

<pre>
dv_finsg(ThirdSgForm, LogicalSymbol, Preposition).
dv_infpl(InfForm, LogicalSymbol, Preposition).
dv_pp(PastPartForm, LogicalSymbol, Preposition).
</pre>

<p>ACE allows two forms of ditransitive verbs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Verbs which take two complements neither of which is introduced
by a preposition (e.g. "John shows Mary an apple.", "John forgives Mary
her shortcomings."). The first complement is considered to be an
indirect object, the second a direct object.
In this case the preposition argument must be set to the empty atom ''.</li>

<li>Verbs which take two complements, second of which is prepositional,
i.e. introduced by a preposition (e.g. "John shows an apple to Mary",
"John succeeds Mary as the president"). The first complement is considered
to be a direct object, the second an indirect object.
In this case the preposition argument must contain the preposition, e.g. "to" in the case of "show" and "as" in the case of "succeed".</li>
</ul>

<p>In case a verb allows both forms (such as the verb "show"), each lexicon entry must be declared twice. Some concrete examples:</p>

<pre>
dv_finsg(shows, show, '').
dv_infpl(show, show, '').
dv_pp(shown, show, '').
dv_finsg(shows, show, to).
dv_infpl(show, show, to).
dv_pp(shown, show, to).

dv_finsg(forgives, forgive, '').
dv_infpl(forgive, forgive, '').
dv_pp(forgiven, forgive, '').

dv_finsg(succeeds, succeed, as).
dv_infpl(succeed, succeed, as).
dv_pp(succeeded, succeed, as).
</pre>

<p>It is recommended to use the infinitive form also as the logical symbol. It is also recommended
to define a third singular form for each infinitive form, and vice versa. Furthermore, it is recommended to
define third singular and infinitive forms for each past participle form.</p>


<h3>Prepositions</h3>

<p>Prepositions (e.g. "in", "for", "during") are represented by only one kind of entry:</p>

<pre>
prep(WordForm, LogicalSymbol).
</pre>

<p>Prepositions have only one word form. Some concrete examples:</p>

<pre>
prep(in, in).

prep(for, for).

prep(during, during).
</pre>

<p>It is recommended to use the word form also as the logical symbol.</p>


<h2>Aliases</h2>

<p>In order to define aliases, i.e. word forms that are parsed in exactly the same way, one has to create several entries
with the same logical symbol. Some examples:</p>

<pre>
adj_itr(gray, gray).
adj_itr(grey, gray).

noun_sg(cactus, cactus, neutr).
noun_pl(cacti, cactus, neutr).
noun_pl(cactuses, cactus, neutr).

pndef_pl('United-States', 'USA', neutr).
pndef_pl('USA', 'USA', neutr).
</pre>


<h2>Word class intersections</h2>

<p>Generally, word class intersections are allowed. E.g. the verb "eats" can be declared as an intransitive
verb and as a transitive verb at the same time. But there are some intersections that are not allowed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adverbs are not allowed to intersect with countable nouns or mass nouns.</li>
<li>Adverbs are not allowed to intersect with intransitive verbs.</li>
<li>Intransitive adjectives are not allowed to intersect with transitive adjectives.</li>
<li>Proper names with a definite article are not allowed to intersect with countable nouns or mass nouns.</li>
<li>Prepositions are not allowed to intersect with intransitive adjectives.</li>
<li>Prepositions are not allowed to intersect with transitive verbs.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following table illustrates these restrictions. Fields containing an "X" denote intersections that
are not allowed. (The gray fields are a mirror image of the white ones.)</p>

<blockquote><p><img src="http://attempto.ifi.uzh.ch/site/docs/images/intersect_080728.jpg" width="600" height="600" alt="Word class intersection table"/></p></blockquote>

<p>In addition, the following function words cannot be used as word forms in the lexicon:</p>

<pre>
null, zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, dozen, there,
and, or, not, that, than, of, if, then, such, be, provably, more, most, are, is, the, a, an, some,
no, every, all, each, which, its, his, her, their, whose, it, he, she, they, him, them, itself,
himself, herself, themselves, someone, somebody, something, nobody, nothing, everyone, everybody,
everything, what, who, how, where, when
</pre>

<p>All other function words (e.g. "can", "at", "true") can be used.</p>
